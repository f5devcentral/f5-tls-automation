## Overview
This Project is a derivative of F5's "Automate One Thing" workshops. Its goal is to build a central example repository for Secrets management on F5 products (BIG-IP, NGINX, F5 Cloud Services, etc). Within the solution you will find examples of TLS automation for different integrations across different platforms.

Guide is located here: https://f5-tls-automation.readthedocs.io/
## Getting Started
Each platform example is isolated within this project. Meaning, you do not need to consume the whole project for a simple task. Navigate to the solution you would like to implement and all documentation and examples are contained within.
## Installation
Outline the requirements and steps to install this project.
## Usage
Usage is not required for any F5 product, these are simply examples to be used for TLS automation
